# Minimum-Absolute-Difference-in-an-Array
# Problem Statement :

The absolute difference is the positive difference between two values a and b, is written | a - b | or | b - a |  and they are equal. If a = 3 and  b = 20,  | 3 - 2 | = | 2 - 3 | = 1 . Given an array of integers, find the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.
